        <!-- <h2>About Whisker & Spoon</h2>
        <p>Once upon a meow, two ambitious felines set out to change the world of fine dining.</p>

        <p>Rupurrt, a seasoned food connoisseur with a deep love for culinary adventures, spent years taste-testing every meal his humans put in front of him (and a few they didn’t). Dissatisfied with the lack of truly gourmet options for cats, he knew something had to change.</p>

        <p>Enter Purrscilla, a young and fearless chef with a talent for blending flavors and an eye for presentation. From the moment she batted her first tuna tartare into pawfection, Rupurrt knew he had found the purrfect partner.</p>

        <p>Together, they founded Whisker & Spoon, a restaurant dedicated to redefining feline fine dining. Their mission? To bring fresh, high-quality ingredients, expertly crafted recipes, and a luxurious dining experience to every cat with a refined palate.</p>

        <p>Now serving only the most distinguished whiskered guests.</p> -->
